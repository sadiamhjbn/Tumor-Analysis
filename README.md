# Tumor-Analysis
## About the Dataset:
The Breast Cancer Diagnostic data is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server.

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
## Workflow:
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Separate Target from Features, Plot Diagnosis Distributions
- Data Visualization: Visualizing Standardized Data with Seaborn, Violin Plots and Box Plots, Using Joint Plots for Feature Comparison, Observing the Distribution of Values and their Variance with Swarm Plots, Observing all Pair-wise Correlations
